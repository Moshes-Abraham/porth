# Porth

Due to certain individuals trying to disrupt the design and development process of the language its reference implementation is closed until it's finished. As soon as I'm comfortable with the design of the language the source code is gonna be open again along with accepting contributions.

In the meantime feel free to do whatever you want with the previous versions of the compiler under MIT license.

To learn how the entire thing have started checkout the playlist with development streams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QP2fDBIxjM&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4
